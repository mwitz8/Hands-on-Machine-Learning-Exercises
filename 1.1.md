1. How would you define Machine Learning?

A program that can learn and adapt on its own by using training data to predict trends in test data. Getting better at some task given a performance measure.

2. Can you name four types of problems where it shines?

Complex problems
Outlier detection
Problems where we ourselves don’t know the trends/ analytics
Dimensional reduction

3. What is a labeled training set?

When the solution (labelled) is given along with the dataset for the algorithm to analyze. Used in supervised tasks.

4. What are the two most common supervised tasks?

Supervised is when the algorithm has a labeled training set and is taught what to do. For example, the training set tells the program whether this data point is a dog or cat.

Regression- linear or polynomial etc on a graph
Classification: is this spam or not?

5. Can you name four common unsupervised tasks?

Unsupervised is when the training data is unlabeled. The learning algorithm teaches itself. For example, the training set won’t tell the program whether a specific data point is a dog or a cat and it will figure out differences by itself.

Visualization/Dimensional reduction: combining correlated data into fewer variables
Anomaly detection: finding an outlier in a dataset, i.e. fraudulent purchases
Association rule learning: finding unknown trends. Ex) customers purchase items together.
Clustering: there are clear categories within the dataset

6. What type of Machine Learning algorithm would you use to allow
a robot to walk in various unknown terrains?

Need trial and error/ punishment & reward. Therefore reinforcement learning/ rule association.

7. What type of algorithm would you use to segment your customers
into multiple groups?

Clustering which is unsupervised learning.
Can also use classification algorithm (supervised learning) with many examples which the model will generalize later on

8. Would you frame the problem of spam detection as a supervised
learning problem or an unsupervised learning problem?

Supervised because the training set is labelled. Even if a new kind of spam gets through the filter, the algorithm will be modified by user input flagging the spam, which is labelled as well.

9. What is an online learning system?

Allows the program to learn incrementally and without storing large amounts of data. The program takes new data, modifies its algorithm and can get rid of the data. This also allows for less ram involvement. Rapidly evolving algorithms.

10. What is out-of-core learning?

Its a type of online learning system. Uses small mini batches from data stored on an external server to learn.

11. What type of learning algorithm relies on a similarity measure to
make predictions?

Instance based learning memorized the training data by heart rather than trying to create a model for a dataset. Not usually good at generalizing. Uses a similarity measure to make predictions.

12. What is the difference between a model parameter and a learning
algorithm’s hyperparameter?

A model parameter is a degree of freedom that the algorithm optimizes to try to make a good model for the data. The hyperparameter (amount of regularization) is a variable that the user controls to protect against overfitting.

13. What do model-based learning algorithms search for? What is the
most common strategy they use to succeed? How do they make predictions?

They do trial and error and find the parameters that lead to the least amount of difference between the training data values and the model by finding the cost function of various functions of best fit and finding the most fitting one. They can also create models based on the benefit. Regularization or adding a large hyperparameter will penalize the algorithm if it makes a model too complex because that harms generalization.

14. Can you name four of the main challenges in Machine Learning?

Undefitting
Overfitting
Not enough data
bad/unreliable data
Incompatible data
Bad algorithms

15. If your model performs great on the training data but generalizes
poorly to new instances, what is happening? Can you name three
possible solutions?

It is probably because overfitting is happening.

Can regularize the model via hyper parameterization
Get more training data points
Get better quality data
Get rid of noise in the training data

16. What is a test set, and why would you want to use it?

A test set is subtracted from the training set and used to test the accuracy of the model after learning from the training set. Finds the generalization error.

17. What is the purpose of a validation set?

Validation set is sort of like a buffer between the training set and the test set. It allows you to tune your hyperparameters and choose the best model between competing models.

18. What is the train-dev set, when do you need it, and how do you
use it?

You need it when you have different data types and you want to test whether your model is suffering significant accuracy penalties because of the data mismatch. The model is trained on the training set and then on the train-dev set and then on the validation set and then on the test set. If the model performs well on the training set and poorly on the train-dev set then it's probably overfitting. If the model performs well on the training set and train-dev set, but poorly on the validation set, then the data is likely mismatched between sets and needs to be improved.

19. What can go wrong if you tune hyperparameters using the test
set?

It's a much smaller sample size than the training dataset so you can really screw things up if you play with the hyperparameters in a set with less data. Your model might then overfit the test data and not fit the rest of the data very well. More optimistic than what it really is.
